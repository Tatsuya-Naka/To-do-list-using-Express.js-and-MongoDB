I created a simple to-do list to understand APIs using Express.js, Axios, and MongoDB. If you would like to use this to-do list locally, please download these files and visit 'localhost:3000' in your browser.

There are five functions overall.

1. Post an item and show this result
   
   As long as you put your plan into an text and push the button, you will be able to see an updated to-do list soon. You can try it again and again.

2. Check items to show a finish sign
   
   Once you completed your task, you can put a check sign into a check-box and that will make you focus on the next task because each completed task will become more noticeable than its default.

3. Delete all items by one action
   
   If you finish your all task or just delete all task, you can implement this action by just pushing "Delete All" button as you can see. This will be helpful.

4. Delete an item

   Campared to before, you can just delete each item one by one and make your plan more clear.

5. Edit your to-do list

   If you make spelling mistakes or just would like to alter your plan, you can do it from an editor icon.
